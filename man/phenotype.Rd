\usage{
phenotype(sEnv = simEnv, errorVar = 1, popID = NULL, locations = 1,
  years = ncol(sEnv$sims[[1]]$yearEffects) + 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sEnv}{the environment that BSL functions operate in. Default is "simEnv" so use that to avoid specifying when calling functions}

\item{errorVar}{error variance}

\item{popID}{population ID to be evaluated (default: the latest population)}

\item{locations}{integer vector of the locations where phenotyping occurs (e.g., c(1, 3) to phenotype at locations 1 and 3. Default: 1, phenotype at the first location)}

\item{years}{integer vector of the years when phenotyping occurs (e.g., 1:2 to phenotype during the first two years of the breeding scheme. Default: the year following any previous phenotyping. NOTE: thus, calling phenotype automatically increments the number of years the scheme takes)}
}
