\title{Define the relationships among locations
NOTE: if this function is not called, genotype by location and genotype by year effects
are not used in the simulation}
\usage{
defineVariances(sEnv = simEnv, gVariance = 1, locCorrelations = NULL,
  gByLocVar = 1, gByYearVar = 1, fracGxEAdd = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{sEnv}{the environment that BSL functions operate in. Default is "simEnv" so use that to avoid specifying when calling functions}

\item{gVariance}{genetic variance in the initial population Default is 1}

\item{locCorrelations}{matrix: genetic correlation in performance between locations default: NULL will cause locCorrelations to be gVariance / (gVariance + gByLocVar). If given, the genetic co-variance across locations is gVariance * locCorrelations. Default is NULL}

\item{gByLocVar}{scalar: the genotype by location variance Default is 1, BUT if locCorrelations given, this parameter is not used)}

\item{gByYearVar}{scalar: the genotype by year variance Default is 1}

\item{fracGxEAdd}{scalar: for GxL and GxY what fraction of the effect is additive versus non-additive Default is 0.8}
}
\value{
Species information and input values for the simulation (list)
}
